## Explanation :

-   **Key observations**:

    -   > Follow the template and just construct the isans(key) api by carefully reading the question

## Solution :

```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, bloomDay: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:
        
        def isans(days) -> bool:
            bouquets, flowers = 0, 0
            for bloom in bloomDay:
                if bloom > days:
                    flowers = 0  # late bloomer hence cant be included 
                else:
                    bouquets += (flowers + 1) // k  # bouqs will be natural# multiples of k
                    flowers = (flowers + 1) % k  # flowers accumulating nd reaching k will be used as a bouq hence reseting at that time 
            return bouquets >= m

        if len(bloomDay) < m * k:
            return -1  # only fail condition 
        
        l, r = 1, max(bloomDay)
        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if isans(mid):
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
                
        return l  # = the least index which satisifies isans()
```
