## Explanation :

-   **Key observations**:

    -   > First, we initialize `left = 1` and `right = n` to include all possible values.
    -   > Then we notice that we don't even need to design the `condition` function. It's already given by the `isBadVersion` API.
    -   > Finding the first bad version is equivalent to finding the minimal k satisfying `isBadVersion(k) is True`.
    -   > Our template can fit in very nicely:

## Solution :

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return an integer
# def isBadVersion(version):

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n) -> int:
        def isans(key) -> bool:
            isBadVersion(mid)

        l, r = 1, n  # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem
        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if isans(mid):
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l  # = the least index which satisifies isans()
```
