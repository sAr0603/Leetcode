## Explanation :

-   **Key observations**:

    -   > **BOTH** lists are sorted and we have to **MERGE** them to find intersection

    -   > Above observation should immediately trigger _merge sort_ idea

    -   > lemma = if `A[i] does not overlaps with B[i]` then A[i + 1] or B[i + 1] **STILL**  may overlap with B[i] or A[i] , similar to merge-step of merge-sort.

    -   > Incrementing pointers = The idea behind is to increment the pointer based on the **end values of two ranges**.
        -   > Proof = Let's say the current range in A has end value smaller than to equal to end value of the current range in B, that essentially means that you have exhausted that range in A and you should move on to the next range. Let's try to visually think about this. When you are going through the images, keep track of end values of the ranges and how the little pointer triangles progress.

    -   > Finding overlapping range = _a_start <= b_end and b_start <= a_end_

    -   > Finding intersection = _[max(a_start, b_start), min(a_end, b_end)]_

## Solution :

```python
class Solution:
    def intervalIntersection(self, firstList: List[List[int]], secondList: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n, m, i, j = len(firstList), len(secondList), 0, 0

        def instersect(fstart_, fend_, sstart_, send_):
            return [max(fstart_, sstart_), min(fend_, send_)] \
                if fstart_ <= send_ and sstart_ <= fend_ \
                else None

        ans = []
        while i < n and j < m:
            fstart, fend = firstList[i]
            sstart, send = secondList[j]
            ans.append(intersection) \
                if (intersection := instersect(fstart, fend, sstart, send)) \
                else None
            if fend <= send:
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1

        return ans
```
