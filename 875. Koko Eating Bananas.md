## Explanation :

-   **Key observations**:

    -   > Follow the template and just construct the isans(key) api by carefully reading the question

## Solution :

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        def isans(mid):
            return sum((pile - 1) // mid + 1 for pile in piles) <= h
        
        l ,r = 1 ,max(piles)
        while l < r:
            mid = l + ((r - l) >> 1)
            if isans(mid):
                r = mid 
            else:
                l = mid + 1

        return l  # = the least index which satisifies isans()
```
