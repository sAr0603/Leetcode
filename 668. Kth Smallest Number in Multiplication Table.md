## Explanation :

-   **Key observations**:

    -   > observation = The following can be transformed into [[378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix]]
    -   > A beautiful **abstraction** reveals that a multiplication table cell can be generated just by a function ![[Pasted image 20210622031730.png]]
    -   > ==def matrix(x, y): return (x + 1) * (y + 1)== a virtual generator object
    -   > Although above one is more sexy ...a bit faster isans(key) api for rows with sorted multiples of a any number is following :
        -   > ![[Pasted image 20210622032141.png]]
        -   > **num // val gives [number of multiples of val] less than num.**

## Solution :

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthNumber(self, m: int, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        def matrix(x, y): return (x + 1) * (y + 1)

        return self.kthSmallest(matrix, m, n, k)

    def kthSmallest(self, matrix, n, m, k: int) -> int:
        l, r = matrix(0, 0), matrix(n - 1, m - 1)

        def getub(key):
            row, col, ubcount = n - 1, 0, 0
            while row >= 0 and col < m:
                root = matrix(row, col)
                if root > key:
                    row -= 1  # go to root.left
                else:  # root is <= key
                    col += 1  # go to root.right
                    ubcount += (row + 1)
                    # since sorted, by transitivity
                    # all els in&above this cell is <= key
                    # which is just row+1 number of elements
            return ubcount >= k

        while l < r: 
            mid = (l + r) >> 1
            if getub(mid):
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1

        return l  # = the least index which satisifies isans()
```
