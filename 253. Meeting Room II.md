### Hints :

-   Topics :
    -   #hard
    -   #greedy
        -   #sorting
    -   #heap
    -   #mergeinterval

    -   > sort meetings by their start time

    -   > stack meetings _starting after closest ending meeting_ to the end of **closest ending meeting**
        -   > NOTE : meetings who successfully stack like this wont need any extra room hence we can pop the previous meeting.

    -   > greedy feasibility = _start times wont fit in gap b/w two meetings due to sorted_by_start_

    -   > greedy-exchange = prevClosest.end and curr.end in the [if] case

    -   > meetings who failed to stack like mentioned in above points will need separate rooms and hence **len(heap)** will indicate that

## Solution :

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param intervals: an array of meeting time intervals
    @return: the minimum number of conference rooms required
    """

    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
        arr = [(x.start, x.end) for x in intervals]
        arr.sort()
        closest_end = PriorityQueue([arr[0][1]])  # closest feasible end
        for start, end in arr[1:]:
            if greedyexchange := closest_end.top() <= start:
                closest_end.pop()  # curr-meeting starts after closing of prevClosestEnd.meeting
            closest_end.append(end)
        # greedy feasibility : start times wont fit in gap b/w two meetings due to sorted_by_start
        # lemma : curr.end > curr.start ,therefore popping
        # prevClosest.end < curr.start < curr.end -> (prevClosest.end < curr.end),
        # we dont couse ruffus in calculating earliest_feasible_end which will now be curr top
        # we can greedy-exchange prevClosest.end and curr.end in the [if] case
        return len(closest_end)
```
