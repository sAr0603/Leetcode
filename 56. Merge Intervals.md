## Explanation :

-   **Key observations**:

    -   > Any **interval[i]** which starts before **interval[i+1]** will only overlap with interval[i + 1] iff :
        -   > `interval[i].end >= interval[i +1].start`

    -   > Hence by looking at the above property we should get the hint of #sorting it by _start-time_

    -   > invariant = in sorted intervals, if any **interval[i]** does not overlap with **interval[i+1]** then interval[i] wont overlap with any **interval[i+2...i+3...i+4...n]**
        -   > Proof = interval[i+1].start > interval[i] , and since its sorted ,interval[i+2...i+3..n] will have larger start time than interval[i+1] ,therefore by _transitivity_ it wont overlap

    -   > algorithm = check consecutive overlaps in sorted array and merge if necessary

## Solution :

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        start, end, n = 0, 1, len(intervals)
        ans = []
        intervals.sort(key=lambda interval: interval[start])
        curr = intervals[0]
        intervals.append([1 << 60, 1 << 60])
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            curr = intervals[i]
            while i < n and curr[end] >= intervals[i + 1][start]:
                curr[end] = max(curr[end], intervals[i + 1][end])
                i += 1
            ans.append(curr)
            i += 1
        return ans
```
